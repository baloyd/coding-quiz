# coding-quiz

This assignment we were tasked with creating a coding quiz using Javascript. The user starts the quiz by clicking on the start button and it activates the timer. For every question answered incorrectly, the timer decreases by 10 seconds. After the user answers all of the questions or runs out of time, the user receives their score and is prompted to enter their initials. After the initials are inputted, the highscore screen is displayed and the user is given the option of clearing the highscore or going to the main menu. The user can also access the highscore from the view highscore link in the top left corner even after the quiz is over and they didn't clear the highscore.![Screen Shot 2021-03-29 at 10 07 15 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78614719/112923460-58166680-90dc-11eb-84ed-a56103478a42.png)
